# Bioreactor-Project

## Project Info
This project was part of the ENGF0001 (Engineering Challenges) module in the first year of Computer Science at UCL.
The project was about creating a virtual bioreactor that would be able to provide an optimal environment to help grow the yeast used in manufacturing a TB vaccine, in normal years this was done as real life project using real machinery and a physical microprocessor. 

We didn't have access to physical components as a result of the pandemic, we used SimAVR to simulate an arduino. We built circuitry using a TinkerCAD and Multisim. 
To see the demonstration, and/or presentation, reach out to an author for the appropriate youtube link.
